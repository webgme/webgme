Authentication
=================
By default authentication and authorization is turned off. This works fine for development and is really no
restriction when the server is running on the user's machine. However once an actual deployment is setup up and users
are starting to collaborate on projects - it's time to turn the authentication on.

The video below shows how to enable authentication and how the user schema works.
