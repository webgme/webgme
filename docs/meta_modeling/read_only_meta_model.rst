Read-only Meta-model
======================
When designing a web app in webgme it may be preferred to provide the end-users with a meta-model that they cannot edit.
Webgme has a concept - the concept of a library - which is a separate project that can be added and linked from another project.

For detailed information see the `documentation of here <https://github.com/webgme/webgme/wiki/GME-Libraries>`_.
