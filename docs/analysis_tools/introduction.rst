Integrating Analysis Tools
=========================
Whereas it is feasible for an interpreter to perform an analysis on its own - in a lot of applications
the analysis is a performed by a separate program (could be a third-party tool). Typically it is the plugin that
handles the triggering and monitoring of the analysis tool. The plugin also handles the result feedback to the user.

Depending on the type of analysis, the expected load on a deployment and requirements on result visualization, webgme offers
a couple of different built in options for handling the analysis.

Creating a process from the plugin
---------------------------------
The most straight-forward approach is to invoke the analysis tool by creating a child-process from the plugin. The major
draw-back of this is that the analysis tool would be running directly on the same host as the webgme server.

One way to come around this is to replace the default server-worker-manager in webgme with the `docker-work-manager <https://www.npmjs.com/package/webgme-docker-worker-manager>`_.

In this tutorial we will simply assume that OpenModelica is installed on the host machine and invoke the compiler/simulator
from the plugin. (The code we written here can without modification be used with the docker-worker-manager approach so we're
not locking ourselves into a corner.)

Executor Framework
--------------------------
An other approach is to use the `webgme executor framework <https://github.com/webgme/webgme/wiki/GME-Executor-Framework>`_,
where external workers attach themselves to the webgme server and handles jobs posted by, e.g. plugins.

WebGME Routers
--------------
The approaches above both assume that the invocation point for the analysis job is a process call. This may not be the
case for all analysis tools. In these cases the invocation call can either be directly implemented in the JavaScript code
or the spawned process can handle the communication with the analysis service.

Alternatively a custom `webgme router <https://github.com/webgme/webgme/wiki/REST-Routers>`_ can be created to proxy requests and handle results.
From such router, practically any tools or services can be accessed and integrated with the user interface.
